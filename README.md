# Database Systems - High Level Overview
The Membership Management System Prototype developed features an integrated ticketing and survey mechanism, streamlining user interactions for database modifications in SQL. This approach bridges user requests and backend processing, enabling efficient tracking and execution of database amendments. I have engineered the backend to simulate real-world scenarios, including appointment scheduling, medical record management, and personal data handling, utilizing randomized data sets for robust testing. This setup offers a unique platform for actionable improvements to mimic real-world scenarios. Additionally, the frontend of the system is designed to present analytical insights in a user-friendly interface. A developer-centric ticket-based model for frontend user engagement, enhancing the overall user experience and operational efficiency.
